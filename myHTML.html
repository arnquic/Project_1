                            <li>5 "+1" Attack cards</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>(If "Special Actions" stretch goal is met) Each player starts with the same deck of nine (9)
                            shuffled cards:</li>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <li>Each player starts with the same three (3) default monsters. Those monsters have the
                            following
                            attributes:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health = 10</li>

                            <li>Defense = 1</li>

                    <li>
                        <u>Draw turn state:</u> During their turn, the active player will draw 5 cards from their draw
                        pile. If
                        there are not enough cards in that player's draw pile, their discard pile will be shuffled and
                        appended to their draw pile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>(Stretch Goal) Deck Supplement turn state:</u> If any cards remain in any of the 3 pickable
                        card
                        piles, the
                        player may select the top card from one pile and place it in their discard pile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Monster Supplement turn state:</u> The active player then must play 3 of the cards in their
                        hand.
                        Each played card
                        is applied to one monster, increasing the indicated stat (attack, defense, *(Stretch Goal)* or
                        special) of that monster by the amount indicated on the card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Monster Action turn state:</u> The active player may choose to attack, use a special, or do
                        nothing
                        with
                        each of their active monsters. Those actions behave in the following ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <u>Attack:</u> Choose an enemy monster to attack. If that enemy monster is in an
                                inactive state
                                (meaning that they performed an action on their last turn), their defense does nothing.
                                The
                                inactive player may choose to use one of their active monsters to defend the monster
                                that is
                                under attack. Upon defending, the inactive player's monster becomes inactive and cannot
                                defend again.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Defense:</u> This action does not take place on the active player's turn. If you do
                                nothing
                                with
                                a monster, they are then available to defend an attack on the other player's turn. (see
                                "Attack" for more information).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>(Stretch Goal) Special:</u> The following actions are available when choosing to use
                                a
                                special:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        (Stretch Goal)* Increase allied monster's Attack stat by "My Special Stat x
                                        0.5".
                                        This increase is
                                        good for one
                                        attack on the turn that the stat was increased.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        (Stretch Goal) Increase allied monster's Defense stat by "My Special Stat x
                                        0.5".
                                        This increase is
                                        good for one
                                        defense on the turn (in this case the turn extends to the other player's turn)
                                        that
                                        the
                                        stat was
                                        increased.
